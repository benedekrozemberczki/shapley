Shapley Documentation
===============================

*Shapley* is a Python library for evaluating binary classifiers in a machine learning ensemble. The library consists of various methods to compute (approximate) the Shapley value of players (models) in weighted voting games (ensemble games) - a class of transferable utility cooperative games. We covered the exact enumeration based computation and various widely know approximation methods from economics and computer science research papers. There are also functionalities to identify the heterogeneity of the player pool based on the `Shapley entropy <https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02153>`_. In addition, the framework comes with a `detailed documentation <https://shapley.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, an intuitive `tutorial <https://shapley.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/introduction.html>`_, 100% test coverage and illustrative toy `examples <https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/shapley/tree/master/examples>`_.
