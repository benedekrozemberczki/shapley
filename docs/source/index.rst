Karate Club Documentation
===============================

*Karate Club* is an unsupervised machine learning extension library for `NetworkX <https://networkx.github.io/>`_. It builds on other open source linear algebra, machine learning, and graph signal processing libraries such as `Numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_, `Scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_, `Gensim <https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/>`_, `PyGSP <https://pygsp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_, and `Scikit-Learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_. *Karate Club* consists of state-of-the-art methods to do unsupervised learning on graph structured data. To put it simply it is a Swiss Army knife for small-scale graph mining research. First, it provides network embedding techniques at the node and graph level. Second, it includes a variety of overlapping and non-overlapping commmunity detection methods. Implemented methods cover a wide range of network science (`NetSci <https://netscisociety.net/home>`_, `Complenet <https://complenet.weebly.com/>`_), data mining (`ICDM <http://icdm2019.bigke.org/>`_, `CIKM <http://www.cikm2019.net/>`_, `KDD <https://www.kdd.org/kdd2020/>`_), artificial intelligence (`AAAI <http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/conferences.php>`_, `IJCAI <https://www.ijcai.org/>`_) and machine learning (`NeurIPS <https://nips.cc/>`_, `ICML <https://icml.cc/>`_, `ICLR <https://iclr.cc/>`_) conferences, workshops, and pieces from prominent journals.
